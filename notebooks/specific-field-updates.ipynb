    "## Mojo optimisation strategy: Only write mutated fields of a large struct ##  \n",

    "If you are looping through a list and mutating the value of a single field in a `struct`, try **only writing to the mutated field in the struct** when putting it back in the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This optimisation was discovered while playing with [this N-body implementation](https://github.com/paugier/nbabel/blob/main/mojo/mikowals_experiments.mojo#L66-L84).  The filename contains my username because I made some initial tweaks that sped the code up and the repository owner wanted to preserve them and keep them separate from other work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Discovered may not be the right word.  To anyone who has ever worked with a database, updating only mutated fields is an obvious way to move less data and consume less compute.  For Mojo though it is less obvious why that would work.  It does seem important in at least some cases though and I have not seen this behaviour explained or discussed anywhere.\n",

For example, trying this optimisation had no impact on Modular's own [nbody.mojo](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/examples/nbody.mojo) example.  That code has three fields and each holds a SIMD vector with four float64 values.  For this demonstration, I have gone crazy and used seven fields with vectors of sixteen values each.\n",

I could also make it `@register_passable` or `@register_passable(\"trivial\")` and it shows the same benefit from this optimisation.  There is nothing special happening here other than making the stuct a bit bulky."

    "\n",
    "And with a large enough number of fields being read or many intermediate values computed, the code could get really slow depending on how elements were written to the heap.  Here it is done the slow way. Writing back the entire `struct` to the vector in the last two lines.(see note 1 below)\n",

    "\n",
    "Note 1: I have strong doubts that this optimisation works anything at all like my initial intuition or how I have explained it so far.  My intuition was that writing one field to the heap is more efficient than writing many fields.  And doing a change that makes it look like you are writing one field is certainly faster.  But do we really know the address of the one field on the heap so we can find it and write it quickly?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify the `struct` to print each time `__copyinit__` and `__moveinit__` are called, you can see we are always working with the whole `struct`.  The code in our `fast_mutating_loop` (a few sections down) does look like it is writing one field.  The trouble is that `__copyinit__` is called on the whole struct that will be replaced.  The mutated field is updated in that copy.  The no longer needed item-that-will-be-replaced is deleted. And finally `__moveinit__` places the now mutated element back into the vector.  Since `slow_mutating_loop` below already got a copy and mutated the desired field, it should be faster just to move that existing copy to the vector.  Which it could do because they are local copies that are not used anywhere else.  But just moving the mutated element into the vector is slower.\n",

    "Any one who can write a correct explanation for why this optimisation works is most welcome.  But for now my intuitive explanation seems like the best way to make it a memorable thing to look for."

    "I absolutely expect that `v[i].a` would lead to the element at `i` getting its `a` field updated and all other fields unchanged.  And that is what happens.  But how to manually manage it with my own `__setitem__` is a mystery.  Also, I am pretty sure based on the extra copy in DynamicVector above that `v[i].a = whatever` is misleading.  I don't think many people would read that code as \"write a new element to v[i] but do it by copying the old element to a new element and then delete the old element\". That it runs faster in the code above is odd.  It has an extra copy and an extra delete.  Move element, update it, put it back.  No copy or delete.  \n",
